    "content": "(This is a talk I gave to 14 and 15 year olds about what to do now if they might want to start a startup later. Lots of schools think they should tell students something about startups. This is what I think they should tell them.)\r\n\r\nMost of you probably think that when you're released into the so-called real world you'll eventually have to get some kind of job. That's not true, and today I'm going to talk about a trick you can use to avoid ever having to get a job.\r\n\r\nThe trick is to start your own company. So it's not a trick for avoiding work, because if you start your own company you'll work harder than you would if you had an ordinary job. But you will avoid many of the annoying things that come with a job, including a boss telling you what to do.\r\n\r\nIt's more exciting to work on your own project than someone else's. And you can also get a lot richer. In fact, this is the standard way to get really rich. If you look at the lists of the richest people that occasionally get published in the press, nearly all of them did it by starting their own companies.\r\n\r\nStarting your own company can mean anything from starting a barber shop to starting Google. I'm here to talk about one extreme end of that continuum. I'm going to tell you how to start Google.\r\n\r\nThe companies at the Google end of the continuum are called startups when they're young. The reason I know about them is that my wife Jessica and I started something called Y Combinator that is basically a startup factory. Since 2005, Y Combinator has funded over 4000 startups. So we know exactly what you need to start a startup, because we've helped people do it for the last 19 years.\r\n\r\nYou might have thought I was joking when I said I was going to tell you how to start Google. You might be thinking \"How could we start Google?\" But that's effectively what the people who did start Google were thinking before they started it. If you'd told Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the founders of Google, that the company they were about to start would one day be worth over a trillion dollars, their heads would have exploded.\r\n\r\nAll you can know when you start working on a startup is that it seems worth pursuing. You can't know whether it will turn into a company worth billions or one that goes out of business. So when I say I'm going to tell you how to start Google, I mean I'm going to tell you how to get to the point where you can start a company that has as much chance of being Google as Google had of being Google. [1]\r\n\r\nHow do you get from where you are now to the point where you can start a successful startup? You need three things. You need to be good at some kind of technology, you need an idea for what you're going to build, and you need cofounders to start the company with.\r\n\r\nHow do you get good at technology? And how do you choose which technology to get good at? Both of those questions turn out to have the same answer: work on your own projects. Don't try to guess whether gene editing or LLMs or rockets will turn out to be the most valuable technology to know about. No one can predict that. Just work on whatever interests you the most. You'll work much harder on something you're interested in than something you're doing because you think you're supposed to.\r\n\r\nIf you're not sure what technology to get good at, get good at programming. That has been the source of the median startup for the last 30 years, and this is probably not going to change in the next 10.\r\n\r\nThose of you who are taking computer science classes in school may at this point be thinking, ok, we've got this sorted. We're already being taught all about programming. But sorry, this is not enough. You have to be working on your own projects, not just learning stuff in classes. You can do well in computer science classes without ever really learning to program. In fact you can graduate with a degree in computer science from a top university and still not be any good at programming. That's why tech companies all make you take a coding test before they'll hire you, regardless of where you went to university or how well you did there. They know grades and exam results prove nothing.\r\n\r\nIf you really want to learn to program, you have to work on your own projects. You learn so much faster that way. Imagine you're writing a game and there's something you want to do in it, and you don't know how. You're going to figure out how a lot faster than you'd learn anything in a class.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to learn programming, though. If you're wondering what counts as technology, it includes practically everything you could describe using the words \"make\" or \"build.\" So welding would count, or making clothes, or making videos. Whatever you're most interested in. The critical distinction is whether you're producing or just consuming. Are you writing computer games, or just playing them? That's the cutoff.\r\n\r\nSteve Jobs, the founder of Apple, spent time when he was a teenager studying calligraphy â€” the sort of beautiful writing that you see in medieval manuscripts. No one, including him, thought that this would help him in his career. He was just doing it because he was interested in it. But it turned out to help him a lot. The computer that made Apple really big, the Macintosh, came out at just the moment when computers got powerful enough to make letters like the ones in printed books instead of the computery-looking letters you see in 8 bit games. Apple destroyed everyone else at this, and one reason was that Steve was one of the few people in the computer business who really got graphic design.\r\n\r\nDon't feel like your projects have to be serious. They can be as frivolous as you like, so long as you're building things you're excited about. Probably 90% of programmers start out building games. They and their friends like to play games. So they build the kind of things they and their friends want. And that's exactly what you should be doing at 15 if you want to start a startup one day.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to do just one project. In fact it's good to learn about multiple things. Steve Jobs didn't just learn calligraphy. He also learned about electronics, which was even more valuable. Whatever you're interested in. (Do you notice a theme here?)\r\n\r\nSo that's the first of the three things you need, to get good at some kind or kinds of technology. You do it the same way you get good at the violin or football: practice. If you start a startup at 22, and you start writing your own programs now, then by the time you start the company you'll have spent at least 7 years practicing writing code, and you can get pretty good at anything after practicing it for 7 years.\r\n\r\nLet's suppose you're 22 and you've succeeded: You're now really good at some technology. How do you get startup ideas? It might seem like that's the hard part. Even if you are a good programmer, how do you get the idea to start Google?\r\n\r\nActually it's easy to get startup ideas once you're good at technology. Once you're good at some technology, when you look at the world you see dotted outlines around the things that are missing. You start to be able to see both the things that are missing from the technology itself, and all the broken things that could be fixed using it, and each one of these is a potential startup.\r\n\r\nIn the town near our house there's a shop with a sign warning that the door is hard to close. The sign has been there for several years. To the people in the shop it must seem like this mysterious natural phenomenon that the door sticks, and all they can do is put up a sign warning customers about it. But any carpenter looking at this situation would think \"why don't you just plane off the part that sticks?\"\r\n\r\nOnce you're good at programming, all the missing software in the world starts to become as obvious as a sticking door to a carpenter. I'll give you a real world example. Back in the 20th century, American universities used to publish printed directories with all the students' names and contact info. When I tell you what these directories were called, you'll know which startup I'm talking about. They were called facebooks, because they usually had a picture of each student next to their name.\r\n\r\nSo Mark Zuckerberg shows up at Harvard in 2002, and the university still hasn't gotten the facebook online. Each individual house has an online facebook, but there isn't one for the whole university. The university administration has been diligently having meetings about this, and will probably have solved the problem in another decade or so. Most of the students don't consciously notice that anything is wrong. But Mark is a programmer. He looks at this situation and thinks \"Well, this is stupid. I could write a program to fix this in one night. Just let people upload their own photos and then combine the data into a new site for the whole university.\" So he does. And almost literally overnight he has thousands of users.\r\n\r\nOf course Facebook was not a startup yet. It was just a... project. There's that word again. Projects aren't just the best way to learn about technology. They're also the best source of startup ideas.\r\n\r\nFacebook was not unusual in this respect. Apple and Google also began as projects. Apple wasn't meant to be a company. Steve Wozniak just wanted to build his own computer. It only turned into a company when Steve Jobs said \"Hey, I wonder if we could sell plans for this computer to other people.\" That's how Apple started. They weren't even selling computers, just plans for computers. Can you imagine how lame this company seemed?\r\n\r\nDitto for Google. Larry and Sergey weren't trying to start a company at first. They were just trying to make search better. Before Google, most search engines didn't try to sort the results they gave you in order of importance. If you searched for \"rugby\" they just gave you every web page that contained the word \"rugby.\" And the web was so small in 1997 that this actually worked! Kind of. There might only be 20 or 30 pages with the word \"rugby,\" but the web was growing exponentially, which meant this way of doing search was becoming exponentially more broken. Most users just thought, \"Wow, I sure have to look through a lot of search results to find what I want.\" Door sticks. But like Mark, Larry and Sergey were programmers. Like Mark, they looked at this situation and thought \"Well, this is stupid. Some pages about rugby matter more than others. Let's figure out which those are and show them first.\"\r\n\r\nIt's obvious in retrospect that this was a great idea for a startup. It wasn't obvious at the time. It's never obvious. If it was obviously a good idea to start Apple or Google or Facebook, someone else would have already done it. That's why the best startups grow out of projects that aren't meant to be startups. You're not trying to start a company. You're just following your instincts about what's interesting. And if you're young and good at technology, then your unconscious instincts about what's interesting are better than your conscious ideas about what would be a good company.\r\n\r\nSo it's critical, if you're a young founder, to build things for yourself and your friends to use. The biggest mistake young founders make is to build something for some mysterious group of other people. But if you can make something that you and your friends truly want to use â€” something your friends aren't just using out of loyalty to you, but would be really sad to lose if you shut it down â€” then you almost certainly have the germ of a good startup idea. It may not seem like a startup to you. It may not be obvious how to make money from it. But trust me, there's a way.\r\n\r\nWhat you need in a startup idea, and all you need, is something your friends actually want. And those ideas aren't hard to see once you're good at technology. There are sticking doors everywhere. [2]\r\n\r\nNow for the third and final thing you need: a cofounder, or cofounders. The optimal startup has two or three founders, so you need one or two cofounders. How do you find them? Can you predict what I'm going to say next? It's the same thing: projects. You find cofounders by working on projects with them. What you need in a cofounder is someone who's good at what they do and that you work well with, and the only way to judge this is to work with them on things.\r\n\r\nAt this point I'm going to tell you something you might not want to hear. It really matters to do well in your classes, even the ones that are just memorization or blathering about literature, because you need to do well in your classes to get into a good university. And if you want to start a startup you should try to get into the best university you can, because that's where the best cofounders are. It's also where the best employees are. When Larry and Sergey started Google, they began by just hiring all the smartest people they knew out of Stanford, and this was a real advantage for them.\r\n\r\nThe empirical evidence is clear on this. If you look at where the largest numbers of successful startups come from, it's pretty much the same as the list of the most selective universities.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's the prestigious names of these universities that cause more good startups to come out of them. Nor do I think it's because the quality of the teaching is better. What's driving this is simply the difficulty of getting in. You have to be pretty smart and determined to get into MIT or Cambridge, so if you do manage to get in, you'll find the other students include a lot of smart and determined people. [3]\r\n\r\nYou don't have to start a startup with someone you meet at university. The founders of Twitch met when they were seven. The founders of Stripe, Patrick and John Collison, met when John was born. But universities are the main source of cofounders. And because they're where the cofounders are, they're also where the ideas are, because the best ideas grow out of projects you do with the people who become your cofounders.\r\n\r\nSo the list of what you need to do to get from here to starting a startup is quite short. You need to get good at technology, and the way to do that is to work on your own projects. And you need to do as well in school as you can, so you can get into a good university, because that's where the cofounders and the ideas are.\r\n\r\nThat's it, just two things, build stuff and do well in school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\n[1] The rhetorical trick in this sentence is that the \"Google\"s refer to different things. What I mean is: a company that has as much chance of growing as big as Google ultimately did as Larry and Sergey could have reasonably expected Google itself would at the time they started it. But I think the original version is zippier.\r\n\r\n[2] Making something for your friends isn't the only source of startup ideas. It's just the best source for young founders, who have the least knowledge of what other people want, and whose own wants are most predictive of future demand.\r\n\r\n[3] Strangely enough this is particularly true in countries like the US where undergraduate admissions are done badly. US admissions departments make applicants jump through a lot of arbitrary hoops that have little to do with their intellectual ability. But the more arbitrary a test, the more it becomes a test of mere determination and resourcefulness. And those are the two most important qualities in startup founders. So US admissions departments are better at selecting founders than they would be if they were better at selecting students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to Jared Friedman, Carolynn Levy, Jessica Livingston, Harj Taggar, and Garry Tan for reading drafts of this.",

    "title": "5 Tips for Starting Your Own Vegetable Garden",
    "content": "Whether you're a seasoned gardener or a complete novice, starting your own vegetable garden can be a rewarding and fulfilling endeavor. Not only does it provide you with fresh, nutritious produce, but it also connects you with nature and offers a therapeutic escape from the stresses of daily life. If you're considering embarking on this green journey, here are five essential tips to help you get started:\r\n\r\nChoose the Right Location:\r\nSelecting the perfect spot for your vegetable garden is crucial for its success. Look for an area in your yard that receives ample sunlight, preferably at least six to eight hours a day. Most vegetables thrive in full sun, so avoid shaded areas if possible. Additionally, ensure that the location has good drainage to prevent waterlogging, as soggy soil can lead to root rot and other issues. Lastly, consider proximity to water sources for convenient irrigation.\r\nPrepare the Soil:\r\nHealthy soil is the foundation of a productive vegetable garden. Before planting, take the time to prepare your soil by loosening it with a shovel or garden fork to improve aeration and drainage. Remove any weeds, rocks, or debris, and incorporate organic matter such as compost or aged manure to enrich the soil with essential nutrients. Consider conducting a soil test to determine its pH level and nutrient content, and make any necessary adjustments based on the results to create optimal growing conditions for your plants.\r\nChoose Your Vegetables Wisely:\r\nWhen selecting which vegetables to grow in your garden, consider factors such as your climate, available space, and personal preferences. Start with easy-to-grow varieties that are well-suited to your region and require minimal maintenance, such as tomatoes, lettuce, peppers, and zucchini. Consider planting a mix of vegetables that mature at different times to ensure a continuous harvest throughout the growing season. Additionally, research the specific growing requirements of each plant, including spacing, watering, and fertilizing needs, to maximize your chances of success.\r\nPractice Watering and Maintenance:\r\nProper watering is essential for the health and vitality of your vegetable garden. Most vegetables require consistent moisture to thrive, especially during hot summer months. Water your plants deeply and evenly, ensuring that the soil is moist but not waterlogged. Avoid overhead watering whenever possible, as it can lead to fungal diseases and water wastage. Instead, use a soaker hose or drip irrigation system to deliver water directly to the roots. In addition to watering, regular maintenance tasks such as weeding, mulching, and monitoring for pests and diseases are crucial for keeping your garden healthy and productive.\r\nLearn and Adapt:\r\nGardening is a continuous learning process, and no two seasons are alike. Pay attention to your garden's progress throughout the growing season, observing how different plants respond to varying conditions. Keep a gardening journal to record important information such as planting dates, harvest yields, and any challenges or successes you encounter. Don't be afraid to experiment and try new techniques, and be prepared to adapt your approach based on the lessons you learn along the way. Remember that every setback is an opportunity to grow and improve as a gardener.\r\nStarting your own vegetable garden is an enriching experience that allows you to reconnect with nature, nurture living things, and enjoy the fruits of your labor. By following these five tips and embracing the journey with patience and perseverance, you'll be well on your way to cultivating a thriving and bountiful garden that brings joy and sustenance to your life. Happy gardening!",

    "title": "Exploring the Benefits of Meditation: A Beginner's Guide",
    "content": "Meditation has been practiced for centuries as a means of cultivating inner peace, clarity of mind, and overall well-being. In today's fast-paced world, where stress and distractions abound, meditation offers a powerful antidote, allowing individuals to find refuge from the chaos and reconnect with their inner selves. If you're new to meditation and curious about its potential benefits, this beginner's guide will introduce you to the transformative effects of this ancient practice:\r\n\r\nStress Reduction and Relaxation:\r\nOne of the most well-known benefits of meditation is its ability to promote relaxation and alleviate stress. By engaging in mindful breathing exercises and focusing attention on the present moment, meditation helps calm the nervous system, reduce the production of stress hormones like cortisol, and induce a state of deep relaxation. Regular meditation practice has been shown to decrease perceived stress levels, improve sleep quality, and enhance overall feelings of well-being.\r\nImproved Mental Clarity and Focus:\r\nIn today's hyper-connected world, maintaining focus and concentration can be challenging. Meditation offers a powerful solution by training the mind to remain attentive and focused on the task at hand. Through practices such as mindfulness meditation, individuals learn to observe their thoughts without judgment and redirect their attention back to the present moment whenever it wanders. Over time, this cultivates greater mental clarity, enhanced cognitive function, and improved productivity in both work and daily life.\r\nEmotional Regulation and Self-Awareness:\r\nMeditation provides a valuable tool for developing emotional resilience and self-awareness. By bringing awareness to the present moment and observing thoughts and emotions as they arise, individuals learn to cultivate a greater sense of equanimity and non-reactivity. This allows them to respond to life's challenges with greater clarity and composure, rather than reacting impulsively out of habit. With regular practice, meditation helps individuals develop a deeper understanding of their emotions and thought patterns, leading to increased emotional intelligence and a greater sense of inner balance.\r\nEnhanced Physical Health:\r\nThe benefits of meditation extend beyond the mind to encompass physical health as well. Numerous studies have shown that regular meditation practice can have a positive impact on various aspects of physical health, including lower blood pressure, improved immune function, and reduced inflammation. Meditation has also been linked to better heart health, improved digestion, and decreased perception of pain. By promoting relaxation and reducing the body's stress response, meditation supports overall wellness and vitality from the inside out.\r\nCultivation of Compassion and Connection:\r\nMeditation fosters a sense of interconnectedness and compassion toward oneself and others. Practices such as loving-kindness meditation encourage individuals to cultivate feelings of goodwill and compassion toward themselves and others, regardless of differences or conflicts. By cultivating a sense of empathy and understanding, meditation fosters deeper connections with others and promotes a greater sense of belonging and community.\r\nAs you embark on your meditation journey, remember that consistency and patience are key. Start with short, manageable sessions and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable with the practice. Experiment with different meditation techniques to find what resonates with you, whether it's focused attention, mindfulness, or loving-kindness meditation. With dedication and an open heart, meditation has the potential to transform your life in profound and meaningful ways.",

Here are some tips to help you navigate the world of online dating and create a profile that captures attention and sparks interest:\r\n\r\nChoose the Right Photos:\r\nYour profile photos are the first thing potential matches will see, so it's crucial to choose them wisely. Select clear, high-quality photos that accurately represent who you are and showcase your personality. Include a mix of photos that highlight different aspects of your life, such as hobbies, interests, travel, and social activities. Avoid using overly edited or heavily filtered photos, as they can come across as inauthentic. Remember to smile and make eye contact in your photos, as this conveys warmth and approachability.\r\nCraft an Engaging Bio:\r\nYour bio is your opportunity to introduce yourself and give potential matches a glimpse into your personality, interests, and values. Keep it concise and engaging, focusing on the aspects of yourself that you want to highlight. Start with a captivating opening line that grabs attention and invites curiosity. Share a few key details about yourself, such as your profession, hobbies, passions, and what you're looking for in a partner. Be authentic and genuine in your writing, and don't be afraid to inject humor or wit to showcase your personality.\r\nBe Specific and Genuine:\r\nWhen describing yourself and what you're looking for in a partner, be specific and genuine. Avoid generic clichÃ©s and instead focus on unique details that set you apart. Highlight your passions, values, and aspirations, and be honest about what you're seeking in a relationship. Whether you're looking for someone who shares your love of hiking or your passion for cooking, specificity helps potential matches connect with you on a deeper level and increases the likelihood of finding compatibility.\r\nShowcase Your Personality:\r\nYour profile should give potential matches a sense of who you are as a person, so don't be afraid to showcase your personality. Share anecdotes, quirky facts, or memorable experiences that illustrate what makes you unique. Use language that reflects your personality, whether you're laid-back and adventurous or witty and intellectual. Injecting humor into your profile can also be effective in capturing attention and creating a connection with potential matches.\r\nBe Authentic and Approachable:\r\nAbove all, authenticity is key to creating an irresistible profile. Be genuine in your photos, bio, and interactions with potential matches. Avoid portraying an idealized version of yourself or embellishing the truth, as authenticity is ultimately what builds trust and rapport with others. Additionally, be approachable and open to conversation, as genuine connections are built on mutual interest and engagement. Respond promptly to messages, ask questions, and show genuine interest in getting to know others.\r\nBy following these tips and putting effort into crafting an irresistible profile, you can increase your chances of attracting compatible matches and finding meaningful connections in the world of online dating. Remember to stay true to yourself, be genuine in your interactions, and approach the process with an open mind and a sense of adventure.",
